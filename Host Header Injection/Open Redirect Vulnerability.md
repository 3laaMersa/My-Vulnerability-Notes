# Open Redirect Vulnerability

## Host Header Manipulation in Redirection Logic

### Scenario:

- A web application uses the `Host` header to construct URLs for redirects.

### Attack:

1. The attacker sends a request with a manipulated `Host` header:

```php
GET /redirect?url=/home HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
```

1. The application constructs the redirect URL using the `Host` header:

```php
Location: http://attacker.com/home
```

1. The victim clicks a link on the website that triggers the redirect, unknowingly being redirected to `attacker.com`.

### Impact:

- The victim is redirected to a malicious site controlled by the attacker, potentially leading to phishing or malware distribution.

## Exploiting Default Host Header Behavior

### Scenario:

- A web application includes a default redirection mechanism based on the `Host` header.

### Attack:

1. The attacker sends a request with a manipulated `Host` header:

```php
GET /redirect?dest=/dashboard HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
```

2. The application generates the redirect URL using the `Host` header and the `dest` parameter:

```php
Location: http://attacker.com/dashboard
```

3.The victim clicks a link triggering the redirect and is redirected to `attacker.com/dashboard`.

### Impact:

- The victim is redirected to an attacker-controlled page, leading to potential credential theft or malicious actions.
