The whole idea of ​​caching in computer science is about taking a copy of a specific content or page and sending it instead of the server to whatever is trying to access it. The same idea exists when using CPU and HTTP requests that sas Js files.  PNG and CSS and database .
The idea of ​​web caching is that existing software or hardware called Load Balancer or proxy server or cache server is a hardware or software  located between the original servers of the backend and the users[browsers] that talk to the backend.


Because of this principle, caches tend to sit between the client/user
 and the server/component. This is very important to understand, in 
order to understand Web Cache Poisoning. In the web’s ecosystem, the 
types of caches that are used can vary. Some examples include but are 
not limited to:

- Memcached
- Varnish
- CDNs (i.e. Akamai, MaxCDN, AWS)


There is a configuration in all caches
For example
To save any file larger than 10 MB
To store files with the extension js, png, css
Every 12 hours, the example.js file is taken from the server
To store files that are sent more than 1000 times, and so on

The idea behind caching is to persistently store “answers” ​​(responses) to frequently requested “questions” (requests) – bypassing the need to recalculate heavy requests. A caching system needs at least two main functions:

1. How long the item will be cached
2. Determine whether or not the request is hitting the cache (hence the fast response) or missing it (hence needing to ask the application)
